I decide to do this project to get a pssing grade for my class. In addition, I want to learn more about the 'potential' process the creator of this website may or may not have went through. In this project, I learned to organize Divs insides of Divs. I learn to customize links so they aren't all blue and underlined. I learned how add box shadows to HTML elements. I learn how to how to not procrastinate. I learn that the `RBRACE` error means that you forgot a `}`.
